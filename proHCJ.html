            <p class="secsubtag text-small">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, such
                as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the
                development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role
                of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that
                education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the
                term. In a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of
                this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as
                the transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals
                increasingly encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society,
                empathy, and complex vocational skills.

            <p class="secsubtag text-small">A teaching method comprises the principles and methods used by teachers to
                enable student learning. These strategies are determined partly on subject matter to be taught and
                partly by the nature of the learner. For a particular teaching method to be appropriate and efficient it
                has to be in relation with the characteristic of the learner and the type of learning it is supposed to
                bring about. Suggestions are there to design and selection of teaching methods must take into account
                not only the nature of the subject matter but also how students learn.[1] In today's school the trend is
                that it encourages much creativity. It is a known fact that human advancement comes through
                reasoning.[citation needed] This reasoning and original thought enhances creativity.

                The approaches for teaching can be broadly classified into teacher centered and student centered. In a
                teacher-centered approach to learning, teachers are the main authority figure in this model.

            <p class="secsubtag text-small">Some students are going to struggle more than others, but there's nothing
                quite like witnessing a student have that light-bulb moment when everything finally clicks. Watching
                student growth, successes, and improvements is a rewarding process. It makes the day fun and keeps me
                smiling. There is never a dull moment.
                Having fun and being excited about learning increases brain-activity of neurons that use Oxytocin
                (pleasure hormone), Dopamine (reward, motivation, learning, senses, thinking hormone), and
                Norepinephrine (energizing, attention hormone) which improve learning and memory.Finally having fun and
                experiencing enjoyment were identified as a proven way to build a socially connected learning
                environment. The analysis of responses indicates that experiencing positive emotions such as fun and
                enjoyment link with successful learning and self-perception of increased well-being.
